 * @brief Implementation of the handler for Quote of the Day (QOTD) data
 * received events.
 *
 * This file implements the QotdReceivedHandler class which handles data
 * received events for a QOTD client. When quote data is received, this handler
 * processes the incoming data and stores it in a thread-safe buffer.
 *
 * The implementation demonstrates how to use the EventBridge pattern to ensure
 * that data handling occurs on the correct core with proper thread safety.

     * @brief Handles the data received event.
     *
     * This method is called when data is received on the TCP connection. It:
     * 1. Peeks at the available data without consuming it
     * 2. Appends the data to the thread-safe quote buffer
     * 3. Marks the data as consumed in the IO buffer
     *
     * Since the QOTD server likely has Nagle's algorithm enabled, we expect
     * to receive the complete quote in a single chunk.
     *
     * The method executes on the core where the ContextManager initiated the
     * async_context_t, ensuring proper core affinity for non-thread-safe
     * operations.
