     * This method is called when data is received on the TCP connection. It:
     * 1. Peeks at available data in the TCP buffer without consuming it
     * 2. Creates a string from the peeked data
     * 3. Outputs the data through the SerialPrinter with chunk information
     * 4. Consumes the data from the TCP buffer
     *
     * With Nagle's algorithm disabled, data arrives in multiple TCP
     * segments based on network conditions.
