/**

 * @brief Implementation of the handler for TCP client connection events.
 *
 * This file implements the EchoConnectedHandler class which handles connection
 * established events for an echo client. When a connection is established,
 * this handler configures the connection parameters and notifies the user
 * through the serial printer.
 *
 * The implementation demonstrates how to use the EventBridge pattern to ensure
 * that connection handling occurs on the correct core with proper thread
 * safety.

     * This method is called when the TCP connection is established. It:
     * 1. Configures the connection to use keep-alive to maintain the connection
     * 2. Disables Nagle's algorithm for immediate data transmission
     * 3. Retrieves the local IP address of the connection
     * 4. Formats and prints a message with the local IP address
     *
     * The method is executed on the core where the ContextManager was
     * initialized, ensuring proper core affinity for non-thread-safe operations
     * like printing.
