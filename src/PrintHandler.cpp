/**
 * @file PrintHandler.cpp
 * @brief Implementation of the handler for serial printing tasks.
 *
 * This file implements the PrintHandler class which handles one-time
 * printing operations to the serial output. When triggered, this handler
 * prints a message and then removes itself from the SerialPrinter's task
 * registry.
 *
 * The implementation demonstrates how to use the EventBridge pattern for
 * self-cleaning, one-shot operations with proper core affinity.

     * @brief Handles the print operation.
     *
     * This method is called when the handler is executed. It:
     * 1. Retrieves the message from the message buffer
     * 2. Prints the message to the serial output if it's not empty
     * 3. Removes itself from the SerialPrinter's task registry using its own
     * address as the key
     *
     * The self-removal pattern demonstrates how to implement one-shot
     * operations that clean up after themselves. When the task is removed from
     * the SerialPrinter, the unique_ptr owning this handler is destroyed, which
     * triggers the handler's destructor and deregisters it from the async
     * context.
     *
     * The method is executed on the core where the ContextManager was
     * initialized, ensuring proper core affinity for non-thread-safe operations
     * like printing.
