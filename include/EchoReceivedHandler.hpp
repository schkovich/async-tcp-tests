 * This file contains the EchoReceivedHandler class which implements the
 * EventBridge pattern to handle data received events for an echo client. When
 * data is received, this handler processes the incoming data directly as it
 * arrives in natural chunks due to having Nagle's algorithm disabled.

     * the handling occurs on the correct core with proper thread safety.
     *
     * The handler processes naturally chunked data (since Nagle's algorithm is
     * disabled) and then outputs it through the SerialPrinter.
