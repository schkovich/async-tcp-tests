/**
 * @file EchoConnectedHandler.hpp
 * @brief Defines a handler for TCP client connection events.
 *
 * This file contains the EchoConnectedHandler class which implements the
 * EventBridge pattern to handle connection events for an echo client. When a
 * connection is established, this handler is triggered and can perform actions
 * such as sending data or notifying the user through the serial printer.
 *
 * The handler demonstrates how to implement the EventBridge pattern for
 * specific event handling with proper core affinity.

     * This handler is triggered when a TCP connection is successfully
     * established for an echo client. It implements the EventBridge pattern to
     * ensure that the handling occurs on the correct core with proper thread
     * safety.

     * The handler can access the TCP client to send data or perform other
     * operations, and can use the SerialPrinter to output status messages.
