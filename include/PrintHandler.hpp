/**

 * This file contains the PrintHandler class which implements the EventBridge
 * pattern to handle one-time printing operations. When triggered, this handler
 * prints a message to the serial output and then removes itself from the
 * SerialPrinter's task registry.
 *
 * The print_handler demonstrates how to implement the EventBridge pattern for
 * self-cleaning, one-shot operations with proper core affinity.
