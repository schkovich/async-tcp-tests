/**

 * @brief Defines a handler for QOTD client connection events.
 *
 * This file contains the QotdConnectedHandler class which implements the
 * EventBridge pattern to handle connection events for a Quote of the Day (QOTD)
 * client. When a connection is established, this handler is triggered and can
 * configure the connection parameters and notify the user through the serial
 * printer.
 *
 * The handler demonstrates how to implement the EventBridge pattern for
 * specific event handling with proper core affinity.

     * This handler is triggered when a TCP connection is successfully
     * established for a Quote of the Day (QOTD) client. It implements the
     * EventBridge pattern to ensure that the handling occurs on the correct
     * core with proper thread safety.

     * The handler configures the connection for optimal QOTD protocol
     * performance by enabling keep-alive and disabling Nagle's algorithm for
     * lower latency.
